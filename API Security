1. Authentication

This is the process of verifying the identity of users.
2. Authorization

This ensures users can only access resources they are permitted to.

    Role-based access control (RBAC): Define roles such as admin, host, and guest.

    Route protection: Middleware should check whether the authenticated user has permission to perform actions like:

        Editing a listing (only the host)

        Viewing bookings (only the user who booked or the host)

        Managing users (admin only)

3. Rate Limiting

Protects your API from abuse and denial-of-service attacks.

    Throttle requests: Use libraries like express-rate-limit (Node.js) or django-ratelimit (Django) to limit requests, e.g.:

        Max 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP

        Stricter limits on sensitive endpoints like login or signup
